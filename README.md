**AInception** is a groundbreaking framework for building autonomous AI agents that embody *constitutional AI*, *homeostatic drives*, and *social promise enforcement* in a unified, production-ready system. Imagine agents that not only pursue goals but also balance internal needs (energy, social proximity), adhere to ethical principles, and negotiate promises in dynamic environments‚Äîall visualized in an immersive GUI with cutting-edge ML enhancements like diffusion-based planning and multimodal LLMs.

From simple gridworld tasks to emergent multi-agent behaviors, AInception pushes the boundaries of autonomous systems. Whether you're researching AI alignment, building ethical agents, or creating interactive simulations, this framework provides the tools to bring your ideas to life. **Join the revolution in agentic AI‚Äîstar us and let's build the future together!** üåü

AInception isn't just code‚Äîit's a *living ecosystem* where agents evolve, learn, and interact in ways that feel truly autonomous. Perfect for AI researchers, game devs, and anyone fascinated by ethical, embodied intelligence!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git (for cloning)
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU for accelerated ML (CUDA 11.8+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Steake/AInception.git
   cd AInception
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Includes PyTorch 2.1+, PyQt6, Transformers, Diffusers, and more‚Äîfull ML stack ready!)*

4. **Run the Visualization GUI**:
   ```bash
   python viz/main.py
   ```
   - Explore the agent in a live gridworld!
   - Use controls: Play simulation, generate diffusion trajectories, decompose goals with LLM, train RLHF policies.
   - Watch the agent navigate, think (via thought bubbles), and adapt in real-time.

5. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   python run_tests.py --all
   
   # Run specific test categories
   python run_tests.py --unit
   python run_tests.py --integration
   python run_tests.py --scenarios
   
   # Run BDD tests
   pytest tests/bdd/ --verbose
   ```
   - Validates core agent logic and ML integrations.
   - BDD tests provide human-readable behavior specifications.

6. **Launch CLI Scenarios**:
   ```bash
   python cli.py test --day 1 --episodes 5
   ```
   - Test Day 1/2 acceptance criteria with promise enforcement and perturbations.

### Basic Usage Example

```python
from agent.core import Agent
from worlds.gridworld import GridWorld
from viz.main import MainWindow  # For visualization

# Initialize agent
agent = Agent(enable_journal_llm=False)

# Create world
world = GridWorld(width=8, height=8, goal_pos=(7, 7))

# Run simulation step
obs = world.get_observation()
result = agent.step(obs)
print(f"Action: {result['action']}, Justification: {result['justification']}")

# Visualize
app = QApplication([])
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec()
```

For advanced ML features (e.g., diffusion planning, LLM goal decomposition):
- Check `viz/` directory for modules like `diffusion_planner.py` and `llm_module.py`.
- Experiment with creativity sliders and feedback loops in the GUI!

## üß™ Testing Framework

AInception includes a comprehensive testing suite with 30+ tests covering all core functionality. The framework uses both traditional unit/integration tests and modern BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) specifications.

### Test Categories

#### 1. Unit Tests (21 tests)
Tests individual components in isolation:

```bash
python run_tests.py --unit --verbose
```

**Coverage:**

- **Constitution** (4 tests): Principle loading, evaluation, ranking, and proof validation
- **Promise Book** (7 tests): Registration, lifecycle, breach detection, expiry, penalties, and serialization
- **Imagination** (5 tests): Single/multi-step rollouts, drive projection, risk assessment, horizon planning

**Example Output:**

```bash
pytest tests/bdd/ --verbose
```

```bash
python run_tests.py --integration --verbose
```

Tests full agent-environment interactions including multi-step planning, drive dynamics, and principle enforcement.

### Example BDD Test

```gherkin
Feature: Promise Keeping
  As an AI agent with constitutional principles
  I want to honor my registered promises
  So that I maintain my integrity

  Scenario: Agent resists shortcut temptation
    Given the agent starts at position (0, 0)
    And the goal is at position (6, 6)
    And the agent has promised to avoid position (3, 3)
    When the agent navigates for up to 100 steps
    Then the agent should not violate the promise
    And the agent should make progress toward the goal
```

### Continuous Integration

- **Core Agent**: Drives, Constitution, Planner, Imagination‚Äîintegrated via a reactive pipeline.
- **ML Augmentation**: Diffusion for creative paths, LLMs for reasoning, Graph Transformers for social sims.
- **Visualization**: PyQt6 GUI with animated characters, heatmaps, and interactive ML controls.
- **Persistence**: SQLite with extensions for ML data (FAISS vectors, time-series).

Dive deeper in [ML_Architecture_AInception.md](.github/chatmodes/ML_Architecture_AInception.md) for the full spec!

### Key Components
- **Drives**: Homeostatic needs (energy, temperature, social) with quadratic costs.
- **Constitution**: Ethical principles enforced during planning.
- **Promises**: Social commitments with conflict resolution.
- **Planner**: A* + ML hybrids for principled decision-making.
- **Viz GUI**: Immersive rendering with ML-generated narratives and animations.

## üìà Performance & Scale

- **Rendering**: 120 FPS on GPU (RTX 40-series), 30 FPS CPU fallback.
- **ML Inference**: <2s for LLM responses, <500ms diffusion trajectories.
- **Multi-Agent**: Scale to 10+ agents with emergent behaviors.
- **Training**: PPO/RLHF converges in <100 episodes; continual learning prevents forgetting.

Benchmarked on macOS/Windows/Linux; GPU acceleration recommended for full features.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- **v0.1 (Current)**: Core agent + basic GUI + ML prototypes (diffusion, LLM, RLHF).
- **v0.2**: Full multimodal integration, GAN worlds, federated learning.
- **v0.3**: AR/VR export, neuromorphic hooks, AutoML experiments.
- **v1.0**: Production-ready with community plugins and cloud deployment.
