## üìã Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints (`from typing import ...`)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public functions:
  ```python
  def step(self, observation: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
      """Execute one agent decision step.
      
      Args:
          observation: Environment state including position, drives, etc.
          
      Returns:
          Dictionary with 'action', 'justification', and 'logs' keys.
      """
  ```

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include integration tests for major features
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies (LLMs, file I/O)

### ML Components
- Document model architectures and training procedures
- Include performance benchmarks
- Provide fallback modes for CPU-only systems
- Use reproducible random seeds for testing

## üéØ Areas We Need Help

### High Priority
- **Multi-agent social interactions**: Expand promise negotiation and conflict resolution
- **Advanced ML modules**: Implement new diffusion architectures, graph transformers
- **Performance optimization**: GPU acceleration, memory efficiency
- **Mobile/web deployment**: Export to different platforms

### Medium Priority
- **Additional world environments**: 3D spaces, physics simulations
- **Advanced visualization**: VR/AR integration, better animations
- **Ethical AI features**: Bias detection, fairness metrics
- **Developer tools**: Better debugging, profiling utilities

### Good First Issues
Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` on GitHub, typically involving:
- Documentation improvements
- Small bug fixes
- Test case additions
- Configuration enhancements

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # Test individual components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # Test full workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scenarios/      # Specific agent scenarios
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bdd/           # Behavior-Driven Development tests
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/   # Gherkin feature files
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ step_defs/  # Step definition implementations
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
python run_tests.py --all

# Specific test categories
python run_tests.py --unit
python run_tests.py --integration
python run_tests.py --scenarios

# BDD tests
pytest tests/bdd/ --verbose

# Specific BDD feature
pytest tests/bdd/step_defs/test_navigation_steps.py

# Verbose output
python run_tests.py --all --verbose
```

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (OpenAI API, file I/O)

### Writing BDD Tests

BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) tests use Gherkin syntax to describe behavior in natural language:

**Feature File Example** (`tests/bdd/features/my_feature.feature`):
```gherkin
Feature: Agent Navigation
  As an AI agent
  I want to navigate to goals
  So that I can complete objectives

  Scenario: Agent reaches goal
    Given the agent starts at position (0, 0)
    And the goal is at position (5, 5)
    When the agent navigates for up to 50 steps
    Then the agent should reach the goal
```

**Step Definitions** (`tests/bdd/step_defs/test_my_steps.py`):
```python
from pytest_bdd import scenarios, given, when, then

scenarios('../features/my_feature.feature')

@given("the agent starts at position (0, 0)")
def agent_at_origin(context):
    context['start_pos'] = (0, 0)

@then("the agent should reach the goal")
def reaches_goal(context):
    assert context['goal_reached']
```

See `tests/bdd/README.md` for detailed BDD testing guidelines.

### Continuous Integration

All PRs automatically run through GitHub Actions CI which:
- Tests against Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- Runs all test categories (unit, integration, scenarios, BDD)
- Generates coverage reports
- Caches dependencies for faster builds

Check the Actions tab for build status and detailed logs.
